Craps Game

  With this game you are given two dice to roll. You’ll need to consider two outcomes:
  
    1. The initial roll of the dice
    2. Subsequent rolls of the dice
  
    The first roll of the dice is important. If the initial roll is either 7 or 11, the player wins. If the initial roll
    is either 2, 3, or 12 the player loses. If it’s either of those two numbers, you’ll need to store that initial roll as the player’s point.
    
    Let’s assume that initially I roll a nine. 
    This isn’t one of the two deciding cases listed above, so you’ll need to record this as the player’s point.
    From here the player will continue to roll dice until the following outcomes happen:
  
    • You’ll roll the point once again. In this case the player wins.
    
    • You’ll roll a seven. In this case the player loses

UNO

Initially both you and the computer will be dealt seven cards. From here the rules are as follows:

    • After the two hands are dealt, the remaining cards are placed in the center of the table face
    down (this is called the draw pile).
    
    • You will remove the top card and display it. This top card will be the start of something called
    the discard pile.
    
    • You and the computer will then alternate turns. When it’s your turn, you can play any card in
    your hand that matches the number, symbol, or color on the top of the discard pile.
  
      o For instance, if the discard pile has a green 6, you can play a red 6, a green 4, etc.
  
    • If you are unable to play a card, you must draw a card from the draw pile.
    
    • Eventually the game ends when either player has no cards remaining.
