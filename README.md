Craps Game

With this game you are given two dice to roll. You’ll need to consider two outcomes:

  1. The initial roll of the dice
  2. Subsequent rolls of the dice

The first roll of the dice is important. If the initial roll is either 7 or 11, the player wins. If the initial roll
is either 2, 3, or 12 the player loses. If it’s either of those two numbers, you’ll need to store that initial roll as the player’s point.

Let’s assume that initially I roll a nine. 
This isn’t one of the two deciding cases listed above, so you’ll need to record this as the player’s point.
From here the player will continue to roll dice until the following outcomes happen:

  • You’ll roll the point once again. In this case the player wins.
  • You’ll roll a seven. In this case the player loses
